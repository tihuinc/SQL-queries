![Alt Problem](https://raw.github.com/tihuinc/SQL-queries/master/employee-department-schema.png)

### Write the following queries

- List employees (names) who have a bigger salary than their boss
- List employees who have the biggest salary in their departments 
- List departments that have less than 3 people in it
- List all departments along with the number of people there (tricky - people often do an "inner join" leaving out empty departments)
- List employees that don't have a boss in the same department
- List all departments along with the total salary there
